I ran the supplemenatry beast xml file from [Lemey et
al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003932) that uses
BSSVS to on coefficients for linear predictors of migration rates. It
took about 12 hours on one CPU on snow, but some of the ESS are close
to 50 for the coefficients suggesting it needs at least four times
more CPU time.

Assuming the numbering of coefficientsTimesIndicators is in the same
order of elements in the testDesignMatrix, I do reproduce the result
that the two non-neglible effecat are seats on air travel routes and
sample size of the recipitient air travel communities.

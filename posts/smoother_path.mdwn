The inputs for the L-BFGS updates after each iteration are the change
in the parameters and the change in the gradient. By requiring the dot
product of these vectors to be fairly large for an update (i.e., above
0.01), we avoid the false convergence seen [[here|lhac]]. However,
this rule causes some zigzagging in the paths for lower
penalties. Below is a much smoother path obtained by letting the dot
product get lower as the penalty decreases.

It seems like a direct maximum likelihood approach to fitting the sort
of phylogeographic linear model [Lemey et
al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003932) could be
useful. We can use a quasi-Newton method with a BFGS approximation of
the Hessian to iterate to better the rate estimates. Then given the
optimal update for the rates and the approximated Hessian, we use
coordinate descent to efficiently update a very large number of
regression coefficients for linear predictors of the rates, possibly
with an L_1 penalty.

The EM approach [Seipel and
  Haussler](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/3/468) could be
  used if a direct quasi-Newton iterations are too slow or unstable.

When the expected number of jumps along a branch is low, it might
increase efficiency to approximate the exact transition probabilities
with a mixture of multinomial distributions. Also, if there are likely
to be enough jumps along a branch for the equilibrium distribution to
be reached, we could just use that distribution.

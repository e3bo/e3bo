An EM approach seems promising. In the expectation step, we compute
the probability of any particular combination of states at either end
of an edge in a tree. The appendix of Seipel and Hausler 2010 shows
how to do this. We go a bit further and calculate these probabilities
given a particular number of jumps, for some hopefully small set of
jumps that includes most likely possiblities. Conditional on a given
number of jumps, the transition probabilities will be
multinomial. Thus in the maximization step we can use something like
Newton's method, and possibly allow for L_1 regularization with an
efficient coordinate descent approach such as in glmnet.

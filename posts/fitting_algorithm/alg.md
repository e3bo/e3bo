# Background and Notation

We will be using some of the equations given by [Seipel and
  Haussler](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/3/468), and thus
adopt their notation to allow for ready comparison. We consider a
phylogeographic model $\mathbf{\psi} = (\mathbf{Q},
\mathbf{\pi},\mathbf{\tau}, \mathbf{t})$ with a relocation rate matrix
$Q$, a vector of equilibrium frequencies $\pi$, a rooted binary tree
$\tau =(N,E)$ with nodes $N$ and edges $E$ and branch lengths
$\mathbf{t}$.

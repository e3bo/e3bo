# Background and Notation

We will be using some of the results given by Seipel and Haussler, and
thus adopt their notation to allow for ready comparison. We consider a
phylogeographic model $\mathbf{\psi} = (\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{\pi},\mathbf{\tau}, \mathbf{t})$ with a relocation rate matrix $Q$, a
vector of equilibrium frequencies $\pi$, a rooted binary tree $\tau =(N,E)$ with nodes $N$ and edges $E$ and branch lengths
$\mathbf{t}$.

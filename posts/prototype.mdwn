Finally got a simple prototype working that seems to indicate that the
pathwise BFGS and coordinate descent approach is not such a bad
idea.  It can calculate a regularization solution path for a model with
an intercept and two predictors. The intercept-only and full fits
agree with simulation, and the path between seems reseasonable.

Stderr:

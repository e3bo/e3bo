Finally got a simple prototype working that seems to indicate that the
pathwise BFGS and coordinate descent approach is not such a bad
idea.  It can calculate a regularization solution path for a model with
an intercept and two predictors. The intercept-only and full fits
agree with simulation, and the path between seems reseasonable.

Records for reproduction:

* [fitting code repository](https://github.com/e3bo/phast-regression) 
* [zip archive with version run](https://github.com/e3bo/phast-regression/archive/v0.1.zip)
* [[bash script|runDev.sh]]
* [[seq-gen script|runSG.sh]]
* [[input-file|init.mod]]
* [[design matrix|designMat2]]
* [[tree|mcc.nh]]


Output:

* [[stderr|se]]
